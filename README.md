I was a PhD student in the [ComSec](https://uwaterloo.ca/communications-security-lab/) lab at University of Waterloo under the supervision of Prof. [Guang Gong](https://uwaterloo.ca/scholar/ggong). I got my MASc in Institute of Information Engineering from [Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://english.cas.cn/). I received my BS in Faculty of Mathematics from [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/).

My researh work primarily focuses on *pairing-based cryptography*, *zkSNARKs* & *privacy-preserving blockchains*. I am also interested in *Fully homomorphic encryptions* and *post-quantum cryptography*.

*Page 21*, "Silimar" should be "Similar".

*Page 52*, Inside Algorithm 7, change the B_0 to B_1 in Line 3 and Line 6. Specifically, 
Algorithm 7 Line 3 should be “if i is in B_1 and q - 2i is in B_1 then”.
Algorithm 7 Line 6 should be “if i is in B_1 and q - 3i is in B_1 then”.
