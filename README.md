I am a second year PhD student in the [ComSec](https://uwaterloo.ca/communications-security-lab/) lab at University of Waterloo under the supervision of Prof. [Guang Gong](https://uwaterloo.ca/electrical-computer-engineering/profile/ggong). I got my MEng in Cyber Security from Chinese Academy of Sciences. I received my BS in Mathmatics from Fudan university.
