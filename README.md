[Updated on Sep 18, 2023]

I recently defended my PhD thesis and started a short term post-doc at University of Waterloo. 

Before that, I was a PhD student in the [ComSec](https://uwaterloo.ca/communications-security-lab/) lab at University of Waterloo under the supervision of Prof. [Guang Gong](https://uwaterloo.ca/scholar/ggong). I got my MASc in Institute of Information Engineering from [Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://english.cas.cn/). I received my BS in Faculty of Mathematics from [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/).

I am now working on *pairing-based cryptography*, *zkSNARKs* & *privacy-preserving blockchains*, *Fully homomorphic encryptions*, and *post-quantum cryptography*.
